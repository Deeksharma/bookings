Optimistic concurrency control assumes that many transactions can
 frequently complete without interfering
with each other. While running, transactions use data resources without
 acquiring locks on those resources. Before committing, each transaction
  verifies that no other transaction has modified the data it has read.
   If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the committing transaction
    rolls back and can be restarted.
