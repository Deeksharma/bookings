sessions is used when you need to authenticate user for further pages as well

https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.md

You don't know which client is sending requests brcause there's no way to find out who is sending the requests, even the
ip address could be shared by by lot of people, that why we need login logout system

cookie and session authentication is one of the ways to tell the server that 'who made the request'

if the website doesnt log you out after refreshing the page then it has implemented session and cookies

client is able to send info anout the authentication status by using cookie, cookie is simple key value pair

web browser saves the cookie internally and sends to the server whenever the client wants to request the server

session is a cookie which will timeout after sometime, it is stored in db of server because if the server stops or fails then the
session id would still be present


whenever the server is stopped and restarted again it loses the authentication of a user because we are using cookies, so that obvious but we dont want to do it in production.
to refrain this, we would need to store our session in redis or maybe in database - please read scm session manager package to learn that
cookies are not ephermal then , it wont disappear if servers restarts
